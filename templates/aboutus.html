      <p class="cd"> Nowadays, humans face various diseases due to the current environmental conditions and their living
        habits.
        The identification and prediction of such diseases at their earlier stages are much important, so as to prevent
        the extremity of it. Disease predictor is used to predict the diseases from the symptoms which are given by the
        patients or any user.
        It would process the symptoms provided by the user as input and would give the output as the probability of the
        disease.So, our main objective is to develop a web interface platform for the prediction of the disease.</p>
